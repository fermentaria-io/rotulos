# About

This repository contains the designs I use for my mead and other fermented
beverages. Feel free to clone it and use it for your own drinks.

You'll need to download [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and
[install the fonts](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_fonts)
that were provided in each folder.
